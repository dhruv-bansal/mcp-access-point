# Product Requirements Document: MCP Proxy Service (Java Implementation)

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: May 29, 2025

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for building a Java-based proxy service. This service will act as a highly configurable and extensible proxy, sitting in front of an API Gateway or other backend services. It will integrate with a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to dynamically expose underlying APIs as "tools" for consumption by AI models or other clients.

### 1.2. Project Goal
To develop a Java application that provides robust proxying capabilities, dynamic API exposure via MCP, and a flexible plugin architecture for custom middleware functionalities.

### 1.3. Scope
The project includes:
- Core HTTP/S proxying engine.
- Dynamic routing based on various request attributes.
- Request and response header/body transformation capabilities.
- Integration with an MCP server for "tool" definition and management.
- A plugin system for extending features like authentication, logging, metrics, and CORS.
- Dynamic configuration loading and management.
- Support for handling JSON-RPC requests and Server-Sent Events (SSE).

## 2. Goals and Objectives

*   **Achieve robust and performant HTTP/S proxying.**
*   **Implement a flexible routing engine.**
*   **Enable comprehensive request and response header/body modification.**

## 3. Target Users & Systems

*   **End-Users**: Client applications or services consuming the APIs exposed as "tools" via the MCP server.

    *   Configuration Stores (e.g., distributed key-value stores like etcd, or file-based).
    *   Monitoring Systems.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Core Proxying Engine
    *   **FR1.1**: The system shall proxy HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 requests.
    *   **FR1.2**: The system shall support HTTPS for incoming (downstream) connections, including TLS termination.
    *   **FR1.3**: The system shall support connecting to upstream services via HTTP and HTTPS.
    *   **FR1.4**: The system shall implement a request/response processing lifecycle with distinct filter callback points:
        *   **FR1.4.1**: `Pre-Routing Filter`: Executed before any routing decision is made.
        *   **FR1.4.2**: `Request Header Filter`: Executed after routing, for modifying downstream request headers before body processing.
        *   **FR1.4.3**: `Request Body Filter`: Executed to inspect or modify the downstream request body (potentially in chunks).
        *   **FR1.4.4**: `Upstream Selection Logic`: Determines the target upstream service.
        *   **FR1.4.5**: `Upstream Request Filter`: Executed before sending the request to the upstream. This is the primary point for:
            *   Modifying request headers for the upstream.
            *   Setting/replacing the entire request body to be sent to the upstream.
        *   **FR1.4.6**: `Upstream Response Header Filter`: Executed upon receiving response headers from the upstream.
        *   **FR1.4.7**: `Upstream Response Body Filter`: Executed to inspect or modify the upstream response body (potentially in chunks).
        *   **FR1.4.8**: `Response Header Filter`: Executed before sending response headers to the downstream client.
        *   **FR1.4.9**: `Response Body Filter`: Executed to inspect or modify the response body before sending to the downstream client.
        *   **FR1.4.10**: `Logging Hook`: For comprehensive request/response logging at the end of the lifecycle or on error.
        *   **FR1.4.11**: `Upstream Connection Failure Handler`: For custom logic when failing to connect to an upstream, including retry mechanisms.
    *   **FR1.5**: The system shall maintain a per-request context object available to all filters, capable of storing:

    *   **FR3.6**: (Optional) The system may implement health checking for upstream services.

### 4.4. MCP Server Integration
    *   **FR4.1**: The system shall connect to a configured MCP server to fetch "tool" definitions.

    *   **FR4.3**: The system shall expose these "tools" via its own API endpoints, as dictated by the MCP server's requirements.
    *   **FR4.4**: Incoming requests to "tool" endpoints shall be transformed into appropriate requests for the target upstream API(s), including:
        *   Mapping input parameters from the "tool" invocation to API request parameters (path, query, header, body).
